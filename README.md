# Advent of code 2023

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

This year I'm trying to solve the puzzles in Go. I'm not a Go developer, so I'm using this as an opportunity to learn the language deeper. Sorry if the code is not very beautiful/idiomatic ðŸ¤ª.

## How to run

```bash
input.txt | go run main.go
```
